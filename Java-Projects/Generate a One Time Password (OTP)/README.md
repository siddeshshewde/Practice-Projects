# Generating One Time Password (OTP)

Many a times we forget our passwords and we opt for Forget password option and within no time we get a new password at 
our registered email-ID or phone no. to login our account. And every time we get a different password.  
  
Sometime we access our bank accounts while shopping from an online store or many more ways, 
in order to verify our transition from the bank account they send us OTP(One Time Password) on our registered phone no. 
or our email-ID, within no time.

The following code explains how to generate such Passwords and OTP within no time and what code we can use if in case we need to do so.  
  
`INPUT`

Enter the length of the OTP you want to generate.
